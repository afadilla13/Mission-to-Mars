Mars Data Scraping and Analysis
This repository guides you through scraping and analyzing Mars data from two sources: Mars News and Mars Temperature Data.

Part 1: Mars News
1. Open part_1_mars_news.ipynb.
2. Use automated browsing to visit Mars News and identify elements to scrape.
3. Create a Beautiful Soup object to extract titles and preview text.
4. Store data in Python dictionaries within a list.
5. Optionally, export data to a JSON file.

Part 2: Mars Weather Data
1. Open part_2_mars_weather.ipynb.
2. Scrape Mars Temperature Data using Beautiful Soup or Pandas.
3. Assemble data into a Pandas DataFrame with defined columns.
4. Analyze:
    - Number of Mars months
    - Martian days' worth of data
    - Coldest and warmest months
    - Lowest and highest atmospheric pressure months
    - Terrestrial days in a Martian year estimation.
5. Visualize results through bar charts.
6. Export cleaned DataFrame to CSV.

Explore the Jupyter Notebooks for step-by-step instructions on gathering and understanding Mars-related information. Happy data exploration!
